Hello, this is my analysis project based on one test case, which describes users' behaviour in a mobile game. Here is the structure of my research
## Introduction
Data overall description, data structure assumptions

## DAU analysis
Here I'm making my first hypothesis about daily average user's characterictics

## Sales analysis
Sales analysis itself after DAU hypothesis taking geographical nuances into account
